📊 Tea Consumption: Are Brits as Passionate as Turks? ☕

When I moved to the UK, everyone kept saying, “Oh, we love tea here! Do you drink much tea?” As a Turkish person, I was skeptical that Brits are as passionate about tea as we are. So, I decided to look at the data.

➡️ Turns out, Turks consume 3.6 kg of tea per person per year, which averages out to 4 cups a day. I know so many people who drink their fourth cup before noon!
➡️ Even the Irish drink more tea than the English, though I’ve never heard of Irish Breakfast Tea...

By comparison, the UK’s tea habits, while iconic, don’t seem quite as intense.

I personally drink 3–4 cups of tea at best, and I still can’t compete with most Turks I know! 😄

What’s your drink of choice?
